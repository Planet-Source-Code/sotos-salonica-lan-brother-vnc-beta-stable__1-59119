open the Project if it doesn't work try downaloading "service pack 6" for visual basic
be sure to give the required VNC password in the textbox before Connecting to a workstation or NOCONNECTION


if it still doesn't work give me feedback so i can help

Feedback and suggestions are Welcome this is Preliminary release so the authors of the controls should excuse me
for not giving credit to them (next realises)
Some of this code is basicaly Cut'n'Paste so if anyone doesn't want me to use his/her source code ,should inform me.


Sorry for my english and the greek comments i will translate them in a future release.
